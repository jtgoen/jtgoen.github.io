        Hi! I'm John Goen, and welcome to my homepage for CSCE 444 with Dr. Kerne.<br><br>
        I'm mostly a backend programmer with an interest in the styling and readability of programming languages as well<br>
        as work in Natural Language Processing and how these relate to our interactions on the web. <br><br>
        This class is allowing me to flex my GUI muscles in ways that I never have before, so I'm sure this will help me<br>
        greatly in allowing myself to become more expressive with my ideas. <br>
